# Toy2LevelDump

This is a "test tool" and is in no way finished. Quite like most of my projects.
All of the required classes are contained within Program.cs. No external deps except .NET.

Also note: Unlike the Toy2Toolbox, a LOT of the .NGN file is skipped to facilitate simplicity. 
For now, this only collects the base level geometry and vertex color data, and spits out a OBJ or TXT/CSV of the vertex positions.
Additionally you can export the "raw" vertices too. These are only raw in the sense of their actual XYZ values, as they have still been fixed for shapes with prim types 5&6 for consistency.

### Essentially, this is a random proof of concept for future Toy2 development/RE.

Built on VS 2022 Preview, using .NET 4.0.
